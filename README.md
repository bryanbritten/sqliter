# Project Overview

This is a SQLite clone written in C that is largely based on the tutorial found [here](https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/).

# Modifications
- Part 1:
  - Refactored the code to utilize function prototypes and move `main` closer to the top of the file.
  - Explicitly used `void` in functions where no parameters were required.
  - Added a Message of the Day to more closely replicate SQLite's REPL.
